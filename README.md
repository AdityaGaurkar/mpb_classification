# Male Pattern Baldness Classification
_"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow: A Deep Dive into AI-Driven Baldness Detection"_


## 🚀 Project Overview
Male Pattern Baldness (MPB), or androgenetic alopecia, affects 50% of men by the age of 50 and can begin as early as the teenage years. However, current diagnosis methods rely on manual inspection and subjective assessments, leading to inconsistencies and late detection.

This project introduces an AI-powered solution that automates MPB classification based on the Norwood Scale, eliminating the need for expensive genetic testing and dermatology consultations.

🏆 Key Features
- ✔ AI-based Classification: Uses deep learning to detect MPB stages.
✔ Non-Invasive & Accessible: No need for expensive medical tests.
✔ Scalable & Efficient: Can process large datasets with minimal human intervention.
✔ User Input Refinement: Adjusts results based on age, smoking habits, and race for a more personalized diagnosis.

📌 Problem Statement
🔹 Lack of Reliable Diagnosis: Current MPB diagnosis methods rely on visual inspection, leading to inconsistent results.
🔹 Ignored Key Factors: Hair density, scalp exposure, lifestyle factors (smoking, race, age) are often overlooked.
🔹 Need for Scalability: Manual assessment isn’t scalable, and genetic testing is cost-prohibitive.

✅ Proposed Solution
🔹 Automates phenotypic analysis of MPB stages using the Norwood Scale.
🔹 Uses deep learning models for classification.
🔹 Provides a reliable, accessible, and cost-effective AI-driven tool.
